/*This program displays the total salary that an employee receives this month. The total salary is divided in two parts: the baseSalary variable, which the employee receives every month, and the bonusAmount variable, which is an additional bonus awarded to the employee.

    val baseSalary = 5000
    val bonusAmount = 1000
    val totalSalary = "$baseSalary + $bonusAmount"

Can you figure out the output of this code before you run it?
